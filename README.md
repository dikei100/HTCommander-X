> **Note:** This software is still an early beta. Expect bugs and missing features. Use at your own risk — usage could potentially brick your radio. Use with caution.

### What's new in HTCommander-X

- **Cross-platform** — runs on Linux and Windows
- **Avalonia UI** replaces WinForms, with Light / Dark / Auto themes
- **Linux Bluetooth** via native RFCOMM sockets + BlueZ D-Bus discovery
- **Linux audio** via PortAudio output + parecord mic capture, espeak-ng TTS

### Download & Install

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/dikei100/HTCommander-X/releases/latest).

**Linux (AppImage)** — works on any distro, no installation needed:
```bash
chmod +x HTCommander-X-x86_64.AppImage
./HTCommander-X-x86_64.AppImage
```

**Debian / Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo dpkg -i htcommander_*_amd64.deb
htcommander
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo rpm -i htcommander-*.x86_64.rpm
htcommander
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -U htcommander-*.pkg.tar.zst
htcommander
```

**Windows:**
Extract `HTCommander-X-win-x64.zip` and run `HTCommander.Desktop.exe`.

### External Software Integration (Windows)

HTCommander-X can interface with external ham radio software (fldigi, WSJT-X, VaraFM, Direwolf, etc.) for digital modes and other applications. On Linux, virtual serial ports and audio devices are created automatically. On Windows, third-party drivers are required:

**Rigctld (TCP) — no extra software needed**
Most ham software supports the rigctld TCP protocol for radio control. Enable it in Settings > Servers. This works out of the box on all platforms — no additional installation required.

**Virtual COM Ports — for software that requires serial CAT control (e.g. VaraFM)**

1. Install [com0com](https://com0com.sourceforge.net/) — a free, open-source virtual null-modem driver
2. Use the com0com setup utility to create a virtual COM port pair (e.g. COM10 ↔ COM11)
3. In HTCommander-X Settings > Servers, enable the CAT Server and select one port of the pair (e.g. COM10)
4. In your external software, configure the other port of the pair (e.g. COM11) as the CAT/radio port

**Virtual Audio Routing — for software that needs audio I/O with the radio**

Virtual audio devices allow external software to send and receive audio through the radio. This requires [VB-CABLE](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) by VB-Audio:

1. Install **VB-CABLE A+B** (paid version) — two virtual audio cables are needed: one for RX audio (radio → external software) and one for TX audio (external software → radio)
2. Configure your external software to use the VB-CABLE devices as audio input/output
3. Configure HTCommander-X audio routing in Settings > Audio to use the corresponding VB-CABLE devices

Note: The free version of VB-CABLE only provides a single virtual cable, which is not sufficient for bidirectional audio routing. The A+B pack provides the two cables needed.

### AI Integration (MCP Server)

HTCommander-X includes a built-in [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (Model Context Protocol) server that allows AI assistants like [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) to control the radio and inspect application state programmatically. This enables scenarios like voice-controlled radio operation, automated monitoring, and AI-assisted debugging.

**Enabling the MCP server:**

1. Open Settings > Servers
2. Check **"Enable MCP Server (AI Control)"**
3. Set the port (default: 5678)
4. Optionally check **"Enable debug tools"** for full DataBroker inspection capabilities

**Connecting Claude Code:**

The project includes a `.mcp.json` file that configures Claude Code to connect automatically. When working in the HTCommander-X directory with Claude Code, the MCP tools become available after enabling the server. You can also add the server manually:

```bash
claude mcp add htcommander --url http://localhost:5678/
```

**Available MCP tools:**

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Radio Queries | `get_connected_radios`, `get_radio_state`, `get_radio_info`, `get_radio_settings`, `get_channels`, `get_gps_position`, `get_battery` |
| Radio Control | `connect_radio`, `disconnect_radio`, `set_vfo_channel`, `set_volume`, `set_squelch`, `set_audio`, `set_gps`, `send_chat_message` |
| Debug (opt-in) | `get_logs`, `get_databroker_state`, `get_app_setting`, `set_app_setting`, `dispatch_event` |

**Claude Code Skills:**

Two built-in skills provide guided workflows:
- `/radio-status` — checks all connected radios and presents a summary
- `/debug-radio` — inspects logs, state, and connectivity to diagnose issues

**Testing with curl:**

```bash
# Initialize MCP session
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}'

# List available tools
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'

# Get connected radios
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"get_connected_radios","arguments":{}}}'
```
